Welcome to LukeExampleRepo!
This is a collection of files to show work that I have done.
Some of this work is solutions to problems I have been given in school, these projects will be labeled as such.
Other parts of this work is solutions to projects given by https://www.freecodecamp.org.
Most of the work done through school is C++ projects. You can run them by first using a C++ compiler then running the resulting executable file that is created.
Files with the extension HTML can be run through your browser. I will add more information on how to run subsequent files that are inserted into the codebase.
I have plans to eventaully develop so tools for linear algebra in the future, because I once had a dream that I failed a linear algebra test.
Have fun looking through the Repo!
Luke
